### Square H4 (model) 
### Point group C2v
### So to avoid D4h (D2h) which converges to the wrong state with pyscf

basis        = sto-6G
n_electrons  = 4
n_orbitals   = 4
geometry:
H 0 0 0 
H 0 0 1. 
H 0 1. 0 
H 0 1. 1.000001   

### Same result can be obtained by Zmatrix
#   geometry:
#   O
#   H 1 0.9614
#   H 1 0.9614 2 104.5136
